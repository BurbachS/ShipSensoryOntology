### C01: Sensors (Ship Sensor Systems)###
#########################################

General
1. What types of sensors are installed on a ship?
2. What do these ship sensors observe?
3. What technical characteristics (measurement ranges or alarm thresholds) are defined for ship sensors?
4. How are sensors connected to ship systems or structures?

Use case specific
1. Which sensors measure engine rpm?
2. How high must the measured value of sensor FuelTank01Sensor be for an alarm to be triggered?
3. What physical property is measured by fuel tank sensors?
4. Where is the fuel tank sensor located?

### C02: Observations ###
#########################

General
1. What types of observations are distinguished on a ship?
2. Which features or properties of the ship or its environment can be observed?
3. Which physical conditions are detected by sensors, and what do they indicate?
4. How are the results of raw data observations represented?
5. How are anomalies modeled as special types of observations


Use case specific
1. What is the average fire pump pressure?
2. What was the latest temperature in the engine room deck?
3. Where are sensors located that observe the volume?
4. What physical properties are observed on deck?
5. What anomalies were detected by sensor PortEngineSpeedSensor?
6. Which sensor records the most anomalies?
7. What unit does the observation of fuel level have?

### C03: Systems and Platforms ###
##################################

General
1. Which systems and structural units on a ship are the sensors part of?
2. Where are the sensors located on the ship?
3. What technical properties are assigned to ship systems?

Use case specific
1. Which device hosts the temperature sensor?
2. Where is the sensor installed that observes the fresh water level?
3. What is the measurement frequency of the system that the fuel sensor is part of?

### C04: Advanced Modeling ###
##############################

Use case specific
1. What were the engine RPM values on 14.03.2021 when the engine room temperature exceeded 23Â°C?
2. Where are the sensors located that observe the highest number of anomalies?
3. Which 'MaxDataType' anomaly observations had a value at least 30% higher than the mean value recorded by the respective sensor?
