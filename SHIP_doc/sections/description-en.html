<span class="markdown">The SHIP Ontology provides a semantic model for representing shipboard sensor systems, their components, and observations. It extends the W3C SSN/SOSA ontology with 		maritime-specific concepts, such as engine components, sensor properties, aggregated and anomaly observations, and domain-specific value ranges. The ontology is designed to support 	condition monitoring, predictive maintenance, and real-time diagnostics in maritime environments.</span>
