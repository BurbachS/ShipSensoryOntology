# SHIP – ShipSensoryOntology
The SHIP Ontology provides a semantic model for representing onboard sensory systems, their components, and observations. It extends the W3C SSN/SOSA ontology with maritime-specific concepts, such as engine components, sensor properties, aggregated and anomaly observations, and domain-specific value ranges. The ontology is designed to support condition monitoring, predictive maintenance, and real-time diagnostics in maritime environments.
In addition to the ontology, we provide a complementary software framework that automatically instantiates individuals based on real-time ship sensor data. This framework connects to operational databases, interprets raw data streams, and dynamically generates RDF instances for live observations and anomalies.
